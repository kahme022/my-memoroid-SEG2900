## MyMemoroid
MyMemoroid was a product me and my group came up with for a web development project in the course SEG2900. We were required to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to design a website for the product, and present it to a panel of CEO as a final project for the course.

## What is MyMemoroid?
Everyone captures moments using their devices. Selfies, pictures, etc. Memories and experiences are stored on our devices. MyMemoroid is a solution to turn memories into something real, something physical. How? Polaroids. Turn your memories into Polaroids using our web service or kiosks located at popular attractions.
